The Marine Landing on Tinian<br />

<p class="in0" style="margin-bottom: 2em;"><i>by Richard Harwood</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">T</span>hree weeks into the
battle for Saipan,
there was no doubt
about the outcome
and V Amphibious
Corps (VAC) commanders began
turning their attention to the next
objective&mdash;the island of Tinian,
clearly visible three miles off Saipan’s
southwest coast. Its garrison of 9,000
Japanese army and navy combatants,
many of them veterans of the campaigns
in Manchuria, had been bombarded
for seven weeks by U.S. air
and sea armadas, joined in late June
by massed Marine Corps and Army
artillery battalions on Saipan’s
southern coast. The 2d and 4th Marine
Divisions, both still in the thick
of the Saipan fight, had been selected
for the assault mission.</p>

<p>The crucial question of where they
would land, however, was still undecided.
There was strong support
among the planners for a landing on
two narrow sand strips&mdash;code named
White 1 and White 2&mdash;on Tinian’s
northwest coast; one was 60 yards
wide, the other 160. But Vice Admiral
Richmond K. Turner, overall
commander of the Marianas Expeditionary
Force, was skeptical. He
leaned toward Yellow Beach, made
up of several wide, sandy strips in
front of Tinian Town, the island’s
heavily fortified administrative and
commercial center.</p>

<p>On 3 July, VAC’s Amphibious Reconnaissance
Battalion, commanded
by Captain James L. Jones, was put
on alert for reconnaissance of these
potential landing sites. On 9 July, the
day Saipan officially was declared secured,
Jones got his operation order
from Marine Lieutenant General Holland
M. Smith, commander of Expeditionary
Troops. His men were to
scout out the Tinian beaches and
their fortifications and determine
their capacity to handle the landing
force and keep it supplied. Accompanying
naval underwater demolition
teams would do the hydrographic
work and locate underwater
obstacles, natural or man-made.</p>

<p>Captain Jones picked for the job
Company A under the command of
Captain Merwin H. Silverthorn, Jr.,
the son of a Marine general and
World War I veteran, and Company
B, commanded by First Lieutenant
Leo B. Shinn. The Navy assigned to
the mission Underwater (UDT) Team
5, led by Lieutenant Commander
Draper L. Kauffman, and UDT Team
7 under Lieutenant Richard F. Burke.
They rehearsed the operation on the
night of 9&ndash;10 July off the beaches of
Saipan’s Magicienne Bay. On the
evening of the 10th, the Marine and
Navy units boarded the destroyer
transports <i>Gilmer</i> and <i>Stringham</i> for
the short trip into the channels
separating the two islands.</p>

<p>The teams debarked in rubber
boats at 2030, paddled to within 500
yards of the beach and swam to their
destinations. Fortunately, it was a
black night and although the moon
rose at 2230, it was largely obscured
by clouds.</p>

<p>Yellow Beach was assigned to Silverthorn’s
Company A. He led 20
Marines and eight UDT swimmers
ashore. They found a beach near
Tinian Town flanked on each side by
formidable cliffs. There were many
floating mines and underwater boulders
in the approaches. On the beach
itself, double-apron barbed wire had
been strung. Second Lieutenant
Donald F. Neff worked his way 30
yards inland to locate exit routes for
vehicles. Nearby, talkative Japanese
work crews were building pillboxes
and trenching with blasting charges.
Neff spotted three Japanese sentries
on a cliff overlooking the beach; now
and then searchlights scanned the
beach approaches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
Silverthorn, Burke, and their men
made it back to the <i>Gilmer</i> safely.
Their impression of Yellow Beach as
a landing site was distinctly unfavorable.</p>

<p>To the north, at the White Beaches
assigned to Company B, things had
not gone well. Strong currents
pushed the rubber boats off course.
The team headed for White 1 was
swept 800 yards north of its destination
and never got ashore. The party
headed for White 2 wound up on
White 1 and reconnoitered the area.
Both parties were picked up by the
<i>Gilmer</i>. The next night 10 swimmers
from Company A were sent back to
reconnoiter White 2 and had a successful
trip.</p>

<p>The reports on the White beaches
were encouraging. Although the
landing areas were very restricted, it
was concluded that amphibian tractors
(LVTs) and other vehicles could
negotiate the reefs and get ashore,
and that troops with little difficulty
could clamber over the low cliffs
flanking the beaches. Marines forced
to disembark from boats at the reef
could safely wade ashore through the
shallow surf. Members of Kauffman’s
UDT party confirmed the Marine
findings and reported that “no mines
or manmade underwater obstructions
were found.”</p>

<p>A few hours after the reconnaissance
team returned from White 2,
Admiral Turner’s objections were
withdrawn and a command decision
to use the northern beaches was
made. On 20 July, a time and date for
the landing were fixed: 0730 on 24
July.</p>

<h2><a name="The_Landing_Force" id="The_Landing_Force"></a><i>The Landing Force:<br />
Who, Where, When</i></h2>

<p>The task of seizing Tinian was assigned
to the two Marine divisions
on Saipan&mdash;the 2d and the 4th. The
third division on the island&mdash;the Army’s
27th Infantry&mdash;would remain
on Saipan in reserve. All three had
been severely battered during the Saipan
campaign, suffering more than
14,000 casualties, including nearly
3,200 dead.</p>

<p>For the 2d Marine Division, the
Tinian battle would be the fourth
time around in a span of little more
than 18 months. The division left
Guadalcanal in February 1943, having
suffered 1,000 battle casualties.
Another 12,500 men had diagnosed
cases of malaria. Nine months
later&mdash;on 20 November 1943&mdash;the
division had gone through one of the
most intense 72 hours of combat in
the history of island warfare at Tarawa.
It sustained 3,200 casualties, including
nearly a thousand dead. Ten
weeks before Tarawa, the division
was still malaria-ridden, with troops
being hospitalized for the disease at
the rate of 40 a day. The ranks were
filled with gaunt men whose skins
were yellowed by daily doses of
Atabrine pills. The Saipan operation
seven months later, led by division
commander Major General Thomas
E. Watson, took a heavy toll of these
men&mdash;5,000 wounded, 1,300 dead.</p>

<p>Watson had earned a reputation at
Saipan as a hard-charging leader.
When the division stalled fighting its
way up Mount Topatchau, he was
unimpressed. The historian Ronald
Spector wrote, in the midst of that
effort, “he was heard shouting over
a field telephone, ‘There’s not a goddamn
thing up on that hill but some
Japs with machine guns and mortars.
Now get the hell up there and get
them!’” His assistant division commander
was Brigadier General Merritt
A. “Red Mike” Edson, who was
awarded a Medal of Honor for his
heroism on Guadalcanal.</p>

<p>The 4th Division had had a busy,
if slightly less demanding, year as
well. It went directly into combat after
its formation at Camp Pendleton,
California, landing on 31 January
1944 in the Marshall Islands where
it suffered moderate casualties&mdash;fewer
than 800 men&mdash;in the capture
of Roi-Namur. At Saipan its losses
reached 6,000, including about 1,000
dead. The Tinian landing would be
its third in a little over six months
and would be the first under a new
divisional commander&mdash;Major General
Clifton B. Cates, a well-decorated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
World War I veteran, who would become
the 19th Commandant of the
Marine Corps in 1948.</p>

<p>Still, “the morale of the troops
committed to the Tinian operation
was generally high,” then-Major Carl
W. Hoffman wrote in the official history
of the battle. “This fact takes on
significance only when it is recalled
that the Marines involved had just
survived a bitter 25-day struggle and
that, with only a fortnight lapse (as
distinguished from a fortnight rest),
they were again to assault enemy-held
shores.... [Their] spirit ...
was revealed more in a philosophical
shrug, accompanied with a ‘here-we-go-again’
remark, than in a resentful
complaint [at] being called upon
again so soon.”</p>

<p>The morale of the troops was sustained
by the preinvasion fires directed
at Tinian. For Jig minus 1 and Jig
Day (Jig being the name given to D
Day at Tinian), Rear Admiral Harry
W. Hill, commander of the Northern
Landing Force, had divided the island
into five fire support sectors, assigning
specific ships to each. His purpose
was two-fold: destruction and
deception to confuse and deceive the
Japanese as to the landing intentions
of the Marines.</p>

<p>Tinian Town, under this scheme,
got the heaviest pounding the day before
the landing&mdash;almost 3,000
rounds of 5- to 16-inch shells from
the battleships <i>Colorado</i>, <i>Tennessee</i>,
and <i>California</i>, the cruiser <i>Cleveland</i>,
and seven destroyers: <i>Ramey</i>,
<i>Wadleigh</i>, <i>Norman Scott</i>, <i>Monssen</i>,
<i>Waller</i>, <i>Pringle</i> and <i>Philip</i>. <i>Colorado</i>
had the best day, knocking out with
60 rounds of 16-inch shells the two
6-inch coastal defense guns the
Japanese had emplaced on the west
coast near Faibus San Hilo Point,
guns that easily could have covered
the White Beaches.</p>

<p>Firing on the White Beach area itself
was minimal for purposes of deception
and for lack of suitable targets.
The cruiser <i>Louisville</i> fired 390<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
rounds into the area before calling it
a day.</p>

<div id="ip_4" class="figcenter" style="width: 541px;">

AND AMERICAN ARTILLERY GROUPMENTS</span></p></div></div>

<p>There was a lot of air activity on
the 23d. At three periods during the
day, naval gunfire and artillery barrages
were halted to allow massive air
strikes on railroad junctions, pillboxes,
villages, gun emplacements, cane
fields, and the beaches at Tinian
Town. More than 350 Navy and
Army planes took part, dropping 500
bombs, 200 rockets, 42 incendiary
clusters, and 34 napalm bombs. This
was only the second use of napalm
during the Pacific War; napalm
bombs were first used on Tinian the
day before.</p>

<p>That evening, 37 LSTs at anchor
off Saipan were loaded with 4th Marine
Division troops. Rations for
three days, water and medical supplies,
ammunition, vehicles, and
other equipment had been preloaded,
beginning on 15 July. The
troops were going to travel light: a
spoon, a pair of socks, insect repellant,
and emergency supplies in their
pockets, and no pack on their backs.</p>

<p>“Close at hand,” the historians Jeter
Isely and Philip Crowl wrote in their
classic <i>The U.S. Marines and Amphibious
War</i>, “rode the ships of the
two transport divisions that would
carry two regiments of the 2d Marine
Division on a diversionary feint
against Tinian Town and would later
disembark them along with the third
regiment across the northwestern
beaches.” (A similar feint was made
by 2d Division Marines less than a
year later off the southeast beaches
of Okinawa, and by the same division
lying off Kuwait City nearly 50
years later in the Desert Storm
operation).</p>

<div id="ip_4b" class="figcenter" style="width: 390px;">
  <div class="captionl top"><p><i>White Beach 2 accommodated two battalions landing in file, with a single rifle company

</div>

<p>The 4th was designated the assault
division for Tinian. The beaches
were not wide enough to accommodate
battalions landing abreast,
much less divisions. Instead, the assault
troops would land by columns&mdash;squads,
platoons, and companies.</p>

<p>The 2d Division would follow on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
after taking part in the massive feint
off the beaches of Tinian Town, hoping
to tie down the main Japanese
defense forces and spring the surprise
of a landing over the lightly defended
northern beaches.</p>

<p>To give the 4th more punch immediately
after landing, the 2d was
stripped of some of its firepower,
such as tank and artillery units. It
would, accordingly, be at the lowest
strength at Tinian of any Marine division
involved in an amphibious
operation in World War II.</p>

<p>Despite these additions, the 4th,
too, would be understrength&mdash;“skinny”
was the descriptive word
used by Lieutenant Colonel Justice
M. “Jumping Joe” Chambers, commander
of the 3d Battalion, 25th Marines,
who was to earn a Medal of
Honor in the Iwo Jima operation little
more than six months later. The
division’s infantry battalions had
received only one replacement draft
after the Saipan fighting. At full
strength they averaged 880 men; at
Tinian the average strength was
down by more than 35 percent to
565.</p>

<p>For all these reasons&mdash;combat fatigue,
heavy losses during previous
weeks and months, and understrength
units&mdash;the Marines on Tinian
would play a cautious game.
Admiral Turner had said he would
give them two weeks to seize the island.
Major General Harry Schmidt,
who relieved Lieutenant General Holland
M. Smith as VAC commander,
promised to get it done in 10 days.
In the event, the island was secured
after nine days. In retrospect,
analysts say the operation could have
been finished off sooner by more aggressive
tactics. Time, however, was
no great factor; the relatively slow
pace of the operation probably kept
casualties at a minimum and reduced
the probabilities of troop fatigue.
Tinian was easy on the eyes, but the
heat and humidity were brutal, the
cane fields were hard going, and it
was the season of monsoons.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak p0">Selection of White Beach</h3>

<p class="drop-cap orangecap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> selection of the northwestern beaches was
universally regarded as the key to the quick success
of the Tinian operation. The credit for this choice,
however, has been debated for years. Carl Hoffman, in his
history of the battle, quoted Major General Harry Schmidt
on the issue: “Many high ranking officers have asked who
originated the plan.... While the 4th Division was under
my command and prior to the Marianas campaign, my
planning officer, Lieutenant Colonel Evans F. Carlson, made
such a plan and probably such a plan was turned in to the
V Amphibious Corps.”</p>

<p>The division’s intelligence officer, Lieutenant Colonel
Gooderham L. McCormick, a Reservist who later became
mayor of Phildelphia, agreed. So did Lieutenant Victor
Maghakian of the division’s reconnaissance unit: “The man
who definitely planned that landing ... was Evans F. Carlson....
He told me all about that Tinian plan before he
was wounded [22 June] on Saipan.”</p>

<p>Others minimized Carlson’s role, including Marine Major
General Graves B. Erskine, who was then the V Amphibious
Corps chief of staff, and Marine Colonel Robert E.
Hogaboom, the operations officer for the landing forces
at Saipan and Tinian. Admiral Harry W. Hill, commander
of the Northern Attack Force, told Hoffman that “if there
were plans and I presume there were tentative ones, none
of them were available to me or my staff.”</p>

<p>Hoffman discovered that before the war, students at the
Marine Corps Schools at Quantico had come up with the
northern beaches solution to the “then-theoretical Tinian
solution.”</p>

<p>But historian Ronald Spector, in his Pacific war history,
<i>Eagle Against the Sun</i>, left no doubt who had forced the
issue. It was Marine Lieutenant General Holland M. Smith.
When he and Admiral Hill proposed the use of White
Beaches 1 and 2, Admiral Turner firmly vetoed [the]
proposal and told [Hill] to work on planning for a landing
near Tinian Town. Hill reluctantly complied, but he ordered
part of his staff to keep working on the White Beaches plan....
[After reconnaissance reports] Hill and Smith tried
once again to change Admiral Turner’s mind, but he remained
obstinate.</p>

<p>In a characteristic exchange, the admiral told General
Smith: “You are not going to land on the White Beaches;
I won’t land you there.” “Oh yes you will,” replied the general.
“You’ll land me any goddamned place I tell you to.” Turner
was adamant: “I’m telling you now it can’t be done. It’s
absolutely impossible.” “How do you know it’s impossible?”
asked Smith. “You’re just so goddamned scared that some
of your boats will be hurt.”</p>

<p>Neither this exchange nor the more subtle efforts of Admiral
Hill served to convince Turner, so Hill reluctantly took
the matter to Admiral Spruance [Turner’s superior]. Spruance
liked the White Beaches idea, but he was reluctant
to overrule Turner, his expert on amphibious warfare. A
conference with Turner and his subordinate commanders
was arranged on board the flagship. All spoke in favor of
the White Beaches. Spruance turned to Turner. The latter
calmly announced that he favored the White Beaches also.</p>

<p>In a letter written to Hoffman in 1950, Turner said:
“... before the reconnaissances of July 10 and 11 were
made, I had (without announcement) tentatively decided
to accept the White Beaches unless the reconnaissance
reports were decidedly unfavorable.”</p>

<p>This was one of those cases, as John F. Kennedy once
said, in which “victory has many fathers but defeat is an
orphan.”

<p class="drop-cap orangecap"><span class="smcap1">Clifton</span> B. Cates, a native Tennessean,
was commissioned in
1917, and was sent to France
with the 6th Marines in World War I. He
had outstanding service in five major engagements
of the war, and returned to
the United States a well-decorated young
officer after his tour in the occupation of
Germany. One of his early assignments
following the war was as aide to Major
General Commandant George Barnett.
During his more than 37 years as a Marine,
Cates was one of the few officers
who held commands of a platoon, a
company, a battalion, a regiment, and
a division in combat. He was the 19th
Commandant of the Marine Corps at the
outset of the Korean War.</p>

<p>His assignments during the interwar
years consisted of a combination of
schooling, staff assignments, and command,
such as his tour as battalion commander
in the 4th Marines, then in
Shanghai. In 1940, he took command of
the Basic School, then in the Philadelphia
Navy Yard. He took command of
the 1st Marines in May 1942.</p>

<p>In World War II, Cates commanded
the 1st Marines in the landing on
Guadalcanal. After returning to the
States, he was promoted to brigadier
general. He went back to the Pacific war
in mid-1944 to take command of the 4th
Marine Division in time for the Tinian
operation. He also led it in the Iwo Jima
assault, and was decorated at the end of
the fighting with his second Distinguished
Service Medal. Part of the citation
accompanying the medal reads:
“Repeatedly disregarding his own personal
safety. Major General Cates
traversed his own front lines daily to rally
his tired, depleted units and by his undaunted
valor, tenacious perseverance,
and staunch leadership in the face of
overwhelming odds, constantly inspired
his stout-hearted Marines to heroic effort
during critical phases of the campaign.”</p>

<p>On 1 January 1948, General Cates
took over as Commandant of the Marine
Corps, remaining until 31 December
1951, when he reverted to the three
stars of a lieutenant general and began
his second tour as Commandant of the
Marine Corps Schools at Quantico, Virginia.
General Cates retired on 30 June
1954. He died on 4 June 1970.

<h2><a name="Jig_Day_Feint_and_Landing" id="Jig_Day_Feint_and_Landing"></a><i>Jig Day: Feint and Landing</i></h2>

<p>The first troop ships moved out of
Saipan’s Charan Kanoa harbor at
0330, 24 July. They were the transports
<i>Knox</i>, <i>Calvert</i>, <i>Fuller</i>, <i>Bell</i>,
<i>Heywood</i>, and <i>John Land</i>. They
were carrying the 2d and 8th Marines
(infantry regiments) of the 2d Marine
Division on a mission of deception
that turned out to be far bloodier
than the White Beach landings and
far bloodier than anyone had anticipated.
They had a muscular escort&mdash;the
battleship <i>Colorado</i>, the light
cruiser <i>Cleveland</i>, and the destroyers
<i>Ramey</i>, <i>Norman Scott</i>, <i>Wadleigh</i>,
and <i>Monssen</i>.</p>

<p>The convoy moved into Sunharon
Harbor opposite Tinian Town just
before dawn. A few minutes after
0600, the <i>Calvert</i> began lowering its
landing craft and by 0630 all 22 of
its boats were in the water. Marines
climbed down the cargo nets. Within
a half hour, 244 Navy and Army
planes began strafing and bombing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
runs paying particular attention to
Tinian Town. Shells and rockets from
battleships, heavy and light cruisers,
destroyers, and 30 gunboats saturated
the beaches. The massed artillery
battalions on southern Saipan thundered
in with their 105s and 155s.</p>

<p>After a half-hour of this furious
bombardment, the LCVPs (landing
craft, vehicle and personnel) from
<i>Calvert</i> began their run toward the
beach at Tinian Town, receiving
heavy artillery and mortar fire from
the shore. Admiral Hill, seeking to
avoid casualties, ordered the boats to
withdraw and reform. A second run
started and immediately drew fire
from the shore; several boats were
sprayed with shell fragments. But
they continued on to within 400
yards of the beach before turning
back.</p>

<p>While the small boats engaged in
this maneuver, the battleship <i>Colorado</i>
came under fire at a range of 3,200
yards from two 6-inch naval guns
near Tinian Town, guns that had
gone undetected during the weeks of
preinvasion surveillance and preparatory
fires. Within 15 minutes, the
Japanese gunners scored 22 direct hits
on <i>Colorado</i> and six direct hits on
the destroyer <i>Norman Scott</i>, which
was attempting to protect the battleship.
Casualties among the crews and
Marine detachments on the two ships
were heavy: 62 killed and 223
wounded. Ten Marines were among
the dead, 31 were among the wounded.
<i>Colorado</i> was through for the
day and limped off back to Saipan.
The Japanese battery survived for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
four more days until destroyed by the
battleship <i>Tennessee</i>.</p>

<div id="ip_7" class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
  <img src="images/i_007.jpg" width="640" height="700" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">FIRE SUPPORT SECTORS FOR JIG-MINUS 1 AND JIG-DAY</div></div>

<p>The losses sustained by the two
ships exceeded those suffered that
day by the Marine landing force on
the northwestern beaches. But the
feint served its purpose. It froze in
place around Tinian Town a whole
battalion of the <i>50th Infantry Regiment</i>
and various elements of the
<i>56th Naval Guard Force</i>. And it convinced
the Japanese commander,
Colonel Kiyochi Ogata, that he had
thwarted an invasion. His message to
Tokyo described how his forces had
repelled 100 landing barges.</p>

<p>These “barges” were reloaded on
the <i>Calvert</i> at 1000 and the convoy
steamed north to the White Beaches
where 4th Division troops had landed
after a mishap in their planning.
An underwater demolition team using
floats carrying explosives swam
to White Beach 2 shortly before
dawn to blast away boulders and
destroy beach mines. The mission
failed because of a squall. The floats
scattered, the explosives were lost
and a few hours later, Marines paid
a price for this aborted mission.</p>

<p>To compensate for the failure of
the UDT team, fire support ships lying
off the White Beaches&mdash;the battleships
<i>California</i> and <i>Tennessee</i>, the
heavy cruiser <i>Louisville</i>, and four
destroyers&mdash;blasted away at the landing
areas. Air strikes were then ordered
at about 0630 and observers
claimed that five of the 14 known
beach mines had been destroyed. A
battery of 155mm “Long Tom” guns
on Saipan fired smokeshells at the
Japanese command post on Mount
Lasso and also laid smoke in the
woods and on the bluffs just beyond
the beaches to obstruct Japanese observation.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak p0">Napalm: Something New in the Arsenal</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Early</span> in 1944, Army Air Corps personnel at Eglin Air
Force base near Fort Walton Beach, Florida invented
a new weapon. It was a “fire bomb,” first used in
combat during the Tinian campaign. The ingredients were
diesel oil, gasoline, and a metallic salt from the naptha used
in the manufacture of soap. Mixed with petroleum fuels,
the salt created an incendiary jelly that clung to any surface
and burned with an extremely hot flame. The concoction
was called “napalm.” It could be dropped in wing or
belly tanks attached to the underside of an aircraft and was
fired by an igniter on contact with the ground.</p>

<p>On 19 July, five days before the Tinian landing. Lieutenant
Commander Louis W. Wang, USN, arrived at Saipan
carrying a small supply of the “napalm” powder and
a film made at Eglin demonstrating the potency of the
bomb. It showed P-47s making low-level drops after diving
from 2,000 feet.</p>

<p>The demonstration film so impressed Admiral Harry Hill
and Major General Harry Schmidt that Hill immediately
radioed Admiral Chester Nimitz in Hawaii, requesting 8,599
pounds of the powder. They also ordered trial raids on Tinian
by P-47 pilots of the Army’s 318th Air Group, using
powder and detonators already on hand. These trials were
not particularly impressive. Their purpose was to burn off
wooded areas that had previously resisted white phosphorous
and thermite. The “napalm” scorched the trees but
left the foliage only partially burned. One problem was the
wood itself&mdash;a virtually indestructible type of ironwood.
Another was the napalm mixture. Wang had brought with
him the wrong formula. “We tried using Jap aviation gasoline,”
according to Colonel Lewis M. Sanders, commander
of the fighter group, “but that gave too much fire effect.
Then we tried Jap motor gas and oil, with the napalm powder,
and it was quite successful.”</p>

<p>The P-47 pilots were uncomfortable with napalm missions.
They dropped their tanks at extremely low
altitudes&mdash;50 feet in some cases&mdash;and were highly vulnerable
to ground fire. They were also unimpressed with the
efficiency of these “fire bombs”; much of their incendiary
effect was wasted in excessive upward flash. Napalm also
had a very short burning time&mdash;less than two minutes.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, 147 “fire bombs” were used during the Tinian
operation, 91 of them containing the napalm mixture.
They were most effective in clearing cane fields. As Major
General Clifton B. Cates, the 4th Division commander, later
recalled: “The first morning they put it down, I went up
to the front line and those planes came in over our heads
it seemed to me like about a hundred feet in the air ...
[They] let go their napalm bombs right over our heads ...
maybe two or three hundred yards in front of us. It was
a very devastating thing and particularly to the morale of
the Japanese.... I didn’t feel too comfortable sitting up
there ... I figured that some of them might drop short.”</p>

<p>Each bomb cleared an area approximately 75 by 200 feet
and, in some cases, left behind the charred bodies of
Japanese troops. The Marines were impressed. Infantry
commanders sought napalm for their flamethrower tanks.
It was used widely in 1944 in support of ground troops in
the Philippines. On one operation on Luzon, 238 fighters
saturated an area with napalm: “The usually stoic
[Japanese],” an Air Force historian recorded, “seemingly lost
all caution and fled into the open, [becoming] easy targets
for other forms of attack.”</p>

<p>Napalm was used effectively in the fire bombing of
Japanese cities. It was also used in preinvasion efforts to
soften up the defenses of Iwo Jima. Beginning on 31 January
1945, Liberator bombers of the Seventh Air Force began
16 days of daytime sorties against the island in which
602 tons of bombs were dropped and 1,111 drums of
napalm were used in an unproductive effort to burn off
camouflage from defensive positions and gun emplacements.
A Marine intelligence officer is quoted in the official
Air Force history of operations over Iwo Jima as saying
that “the chief effect of the long bombardment of Iwo was
to cause the enemy to build more elaborate underground
defenses.”

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="The_Landing" id="The_Landing"></a><i>The Landing</i></h2>

<p>The assault plan assigned White
Beach 1 to the 24th Marines and
White Beach Two to the 25th. In the
vanguard for the 24th was Company
E of the 2d Battalion&mdash;200 men commanded
by Captain Jack F. Ross, Jr.
Company A of the 1st Battalion,
commanded by Captain Irving
Schechter, followed and by 0820 the
entire 2d Battalion, commanded by
Major Frank A. Garretson, was
ashore.</p>

<p>Almost simultaneously, two battalions
of the 25th Marines loaded
into 16 LVTs landed in columns of
companies on White Beach 2. The 2d
Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel
Lewis C. Hudson, Jr., was on the
right; the 3d Battalion (Lieutenant
Colonel Chambers) was on the left.</p>

<p>The units of the 24th, loaded into
24 LVTs, crossed the line of departure&mdash;3,000
yards offshore&mdash;at 0717.
Ahead of them, 30 LCIs (landing
craft, infantry) and a company of the
2d Armored Amphibian Battalion,
commanded by Lieutenant Colonel
Reed M. Fawell, Jr., raked the
beaches with barrage rockets and automatic
cannon fire. On the 26-minute
run to the beach, the troop-laden
LVTs took scattered and ineffectual
rifle and machine gun fire.</p>

<p>At White 1, members of a small
Japanese beach detachment, holed
up in caves and crevices, resisted the
landing with intense small arms fire.
But they were silenced quickly by
Company E gunners.</p>

<p>Within an hour, the entire 1st and
2d Battalions of the 24th were ashore
on White 1, preparing to move inland.
The 2d Battalion encountered
sporadic artillery, mortar, and small
arms fire during the first 200 yards
of its advance. After that, Garretson
later said, the battalion had a “cake
walk” for the rest of the day gaining
1,400 yards and reaching its O-1 line
objective by 1600. He occupied the
western edge of Airfield No. 3 and
cut the main road linking Airfield
No. 1 with the east coast and
southern Tinian. Only occasional
small arms fire was encountered before
the battalion dug in for the
night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span></p>

<div id="ip_8" class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
  <img src="images/i_008.jpg" width="700" height="673" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">PLANS FOR LANDING</div></div>

<p>On Garretson’s left, the 1st Battalion,
commanded by Lieutenant
Colonel Otto Lessing, was slowed by
heavy fires from cave positions and
patches of heavy vegetation.
Flamethrower tanks were sent up
against these positions, but the
Japanese held on. As a result, Lessing
pulled up late in the afternoon
400 yards short of his objective. This
left a gap between his perimeter and
Garretson’s. To fill it, the regiment’s
3d Battalion, waiting in reserve at the
beach, was called up.</p>

<p>Almost simultaneously, the 25th
ran into problems. The beach and
surrounding area had been methodically
seeded with mines which
neither UDT teams nor offshore gunners
had been able to destroy. It took
six hours to clear them out and in the
process three LVTs and a jeep were
blown up. The beach defenses also
included a sprinkling of booby traps
which had to be dealt with&mdash;watches
and cases of beer, for example, all
wired to explode in the hands of careless
souvenir hunters.</p>

<p>Behind the beach, troops from
Ogata’s <i>50th Regiment</i> put up a
vigorous defense with mortars, anti-tank
and anti-boat guns, and other
automatic weapons emplaced in pillboxes,
caves, fortified ravines, and
field entrenchments. Two 47mm guns
in particular kept the Marines back
on their heels. They finally bypassed
these troublesome positions. Later
waves took them out, leaving 50
dead Japanese in the gunpits.</p>

<p>The 3d Battalion commander,
Lieutenant Colonel Chambers, later
remembered a lot of confusion on the
beach, “the confusion you [always]
get when you land, of getting the organization
together again.” One of his
company commanders, for example,
was killed a half-hour after landing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
and it took a while to get a replacement
on scene and up to speed. Then
there was the problem of the mines
and a problem with artillery fire
from the Japanese command post on
Mount Lasso, two-and-a-half miles
away.</p>

<p>By late afternoon, Chambers’ battalion
had reached its objective 1,500
yards inland in the center of the line
and had tied in on its left flank with
Garretson of the 24th. The other battalions
of the 25th came up short of
their O-1 line, creating before sundown
a crescent-shaped beachhead
3,000 yards wide at the shoreline and
bulging inland to a maximum depth
of 1,500 yards.</p>

<p>The day’s greatest confusion surrounded
the landing of the 23d Marines.
The regiment had been held on
LSTs (landing ships, tank) in division
reserve during the landing of the 24th
and 25th. At 0730, the troops were
ordered below to board LVTs parked
cheek to jowl on the tank decks.
Their engines were running, spewing
forth carbon monoxide. Experience
had shown that troops cooped up
under these conditions for more than
30 minutes would develop severe
headaches, become nauseous, and
begin vomiting.</p>

<p>To avoid that problem and in the
absence of a launch order, the
regimental commander, Colonel
Louis R. Jones, soon unloaded his
men and sent them topside. They
returned to the tank decks at 1030
when an order to load and launch finally
was received. The regiment debarked
and eventually got ashore
beginning at 1400 despite an incredible
series of communication breakdowns
in which Jones at crucial times
was out of touch with the division
and his battalions.</p>

<p>In addition to botched radio communications,
Jones was stuck in an
LVT with a bad engine; it took him
seven hours to get ashore with his
staff, leading to a division complaint
about the tardiness of his regiment.
The division noted that “fortunately
no serious harm was done by [the]
delay,” but at the end of the operation
Jones left the division. He was
promoted to brigadier general and assigned
as assistant division commander
of the 1st Marine Division
for the Okinawa landings.</p>

<p>A similar muck-up occurred involving
the 2d Marine Division. After
the feint at Tinian Town, the
division sailed north and lay offshore
of the White Beaches through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
day. At 1515, the landing force commander,
Major General Harry
Schmidt, ordered a battalion from
the 8th Marines to land at White
Beach to back up the 24th Marines.
Schmidt wanted the battalion ashore
at 1600. Because of communication
and transport confusion the deadline
was missed. It was 2000 when the
unit entered in its log “... dug in in
assigned position.”</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>TINIAN<br />

<span class="subhead">24&ndash;26 JULY 1944</span></p></div></div>

<p>On the other hand, the big things
had gone well in the morning and afternoon.
By the standards of Tarawa
and Saipan, casualties were light&mdash;15
dead, 225 wounded. The body count
for the Japanese was 438. Despite
drizzling rain, narrow beaches, and
undiscovered mines, 15,600 troops
were put ashore along with great
quantities of materiel and equipment
that included four battalions of artillery,
two dozen half-tracks mounting
75mm guns, and 48 medium and
15 flame-throwing tanks which
found the Tinian terrain hospitable
for tank operations. The tanks had
gotten into action early that morning,
leading the 24th in tank-infantry
attacks. They also had come to the
aid of the 23d Marines as that regiment
moved inland to take over the
division’s right flank. The beachhead
itself was of respectable size, despite
the failure of some units to reach
their first-day objectives. It extended
inland nearly a mile and embraced
defensible territory. On the whole, it
had not been a bad day’s work.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak p0">Tinian Defense Forces</h3>

<p class="drop-cap orangecap"><span class="smcap1">Japanese</span> military fortification of Tinian and other
islands in the chain had begun&mdash;in violation of the
League of Nations Mandate&mdash;in the 1930s. By 1944, the
Tinian garrison numbered roughly 9,000 army and navy personnel,
bringing the island’s total population to nearly 25,000.</p>

<p>The <i>50th Infantry Regiment</i>, detached from the <i>29th Division</i>
on Guam, was the principal fighting force. It had been
stationed near Mukden, Manchuria, from 1941 until its transfer
in March 1944 to Tinian. Many of its troops were veterans
of the Manchurian campaigns. The regiment was
commanded by Colonel Kiyoshi [also spelled “Keishi”] Ogata
and consisted of three 880-man infantry battalions, a
75mm mountain artillery battalion equipped with 12 guns,
engineer, communication, and medical companies, plus a
headquarters and various specialized support units, including
a company of 12 light tanks and an anti-tank platoon.
He also had a battalion of the <i>135th Infantry Regiment</i> with
a strength of about 900 men. Altogether, slightly more than
5,000 army troops were assigned to the island’s defense.</p>

<p>The principal navy unit was the <i>56th Naval Guard Force</i>,
a 1,400-man coastal defense unit, supplemented by four construction
battalions with a combined strength of 1,800 men.
Other naval units, totaling about 1,000 men, included ground
elements of seven aviation squadrons and a detachment of
the <i>5th Base Force</i>.</p>

<p>The navy personnel&mdash;about 4,200 altogether&mdash;were under
the immediate command of Captain Oichi Oya. Both Oya and
Ogata were outranked on the island by Vice Admiral Kakuji
Kakuda, commander of the <i>1st Air Fleet</i> with headquarters
on Tinian. But Kakuda, as the invasion neared, had no air
fleet to command. Of the estimated 107 planes based at Tinian’s
air fields, 70 had been destroyed on the ground early in
June by U.S. air strikes. By the time of the Tinian landing on
24 July, none of Kakuda’s planes were operative.</p>

<p>Kakuda had a bad reputation. He was, by Japanese physical
standards, a hulking figure: more than six feet tall, weighing
more than 200 pounds. “He willingly catered,” Hoffman
wrote, “to his almost unquenchable thirst for liquor; he lacked
the fortitude to face the odds arrayed against him at Tinian.”
Historian Frank Hough called him “a drunk and an exceedingly
unpleasant one, from all accounts.”</p>

<p>On 15 July, nine days before the invasion, Kakuda and his
headquarters group attempted to escape via rubber boats to
Aguijan Island where they hoped to rendezvous with a
Japanese submarine. This effort failed. He tried again on five
successive nights with the same results, finally abandoning the
effort on 21 July. He fled with his party from Tinian Town
to a cave on Tinian’s east coast where they awaited their fate.
A Japanese prisoner who described Kakuda’s escape efforts
assumed he had committed suicide after the American landing,
but this was never verified. Toward the end of the battle
for Tinian, one of Kakuda’s orderlies led an American patrol
to the cave. The patrol was fired upon and two Marines were
wounded. A passing group of Marine pioneers sealed the cave
with demolition charges but it is unknown whether Kakuda
was inside.</p>

<p>Admiral Kakuda in any case took no part in directing the
Japanese resistance. For purposes of defending the island, command
of both army and navy forces was assumed by Colonel
Ogata, but co-operation between the two service branches was
less than complete. Frictions were reflected in diaries found
among the Japanese documents captured on Tinian. A soldier
in the <i>50th Regiment</i>’s artillery battalion wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>9 March&mdash;The Navy stays in barracks buildings
and has liberty every night with liquor to drink and
makes a big row.</p>

<p>We, on the other hand, bivouac in the rain and
never get out on pass. What a difference in discipline!</p>

<p>12 June&mdash;Our AA guns [manned by the Navy]
spread black smoke where the enemy planes weren’t.
Not one hit out of a thousand shots. The Naval Air
Group has taken to its heels.</p>

<p>15 June&mdash;The naval aviators are robbers.... When
they ran off to the mountains, they stole Army provisions....</p></blockquote>

<p>The defenses of Tinian were dictated by the geography of
the island. It is encircled by coral cliffs which rise from the
coastline and are a part of the limestone plateau underlying
the island. These cliffs range in height from 6 to 100 feet;
breaks in the cliff line are rare and where they occur are narrow,
leaving little beach space for an invasion force. Along
the entire coastline of Tinian, only four beaches were worthy
of the name.</p>

<p>The largest and most suitable for use by an amphibious
force was in front of Tinian Town in Suharon Harbor. It consisted
of several wide, sandy strips. The harbor was mediocre
but provided in fair weather limited anchorage for a few ships
which could load and unload cargo at two piers available at
Tinian Town.</p>

<p>From the beginning, Colonel Ogata assumed that this beach
would be the first choice of the Americans. Of the roughly
100 guns in fixed positions on the island&mdash;ranging from 7.7mm
heavy machine guns to 6-inch British naval rifles&mdash;nearly a
third were assigned to the defense of Tinian Town and its
beaches and to the airfield at Gurguan Point, two-and-a-half
miles northwest of the town. Within a two-mile radius of the
town were the <i>2d Battalion</i> of the <i>50th Infantry Regiment</i>,
1,400 men of the <i>56th Naval Guard Force</i>, a tank company
of the <i>18th Infantry Regiment</i>, and the <i>1st Battalion, 135th
Infantry Regiment</i>, which had been designated as the mobile
counterattack force.</p>

<p>Their area of responsibility extended to Laslo Point, the
southernmost part of the island and, on the east, to Masalog
Point. It was designated the “Southern Sector” in Ogata’s
defense plan.</p>

<p>The remainder of the island was divided into northeastern
and northwestern sectors. The northeastern sector included
the Ushi Point airfields and a potential landing beach 125 yards
wide south of Asiga Point on the east coast of the island. In
this sector, between 600 and 1,000 navy personnel were stationed
around the Ushi Airfields. The <i>2d Battalion</i> of the <i>50th
Infantry Regiment</i>, along with an engineer group, was stationed
inland of Asagi Point. The northwestern sector contained
two narrow strips of beach 1,000 yards apart. One of
them was 60 yards wide and the other about 160. They were
popular with Japanese civilians. The sand was white and the
water was swimmable. They were known locally as the White
Beaches and that is what they were called when they were
chosen&mdash;to the great surprise of the Japanese&mdash;as the American
invasion route.</p>

<p>This sector was defended very modestly by a single company
of infantry, an antitank squad, and, about 500 yards
northeast of the White Beaches, gun crews situated in emplacements
containing one 37mm antitank gun, one 47mm antitank
gun, and two 7.7mm machine guns.</p>

<p>Ogata established his command post in a cave on Mount
Lasso in the center of the northern region, roughly
equidistant&mdash;a little over two miles&mdash;from beaches on either
side of the island.</p>

<p>He issued on 25 June an operation order saying “the enemy
on Saipan can be expected to be planning a landing on Tinian.
The area of that landing is estimated to be either Tinian
Harbor or Asiga Harbor [on the northeast coast].” Three days
later he followed up with a “Defense Force Battle Plan” which
outlined only two contingencies:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(A) In the event the enemy lands at Tinian Harbor.</p>

<p>(B) In the event the enemy lands at Asiga Bay.</p></blockquote>

<p>On 7 July Ogata issued a “Plan for the Guidance of Battle”
ordering his men to be prepared not only for landings at Tinian
Town and Asiga Bay, but also for a counterattack
in the event the Americans were to invade across the White
Beaches.</p>

<p>In each of the three sectors, according to his battle plan,
commanders were to be prepared to “destroy the enemy at the
beach, but [also] be prepared to shift two-thirds of the force
elsewhere.” His reserve force was to “maintain fortified positions,
counterattack points [and] maintain anti-aircraft observation
and fire in its area.” The “Mobile Counterattack
Force” must “advance rapidly to the place of landings, depending
on the situation and attack.” In the event of
successful landings his forces would “counterattack to the water
and ... destroy the enemy on beaches with one blow, especially
where time prevents quick movement of forces within
the island.” If things were to go badly, “we will gradually fall
back on our prepared positions in the southern part of the
island and defend them to the last man.”</p>

<p>Some of these orders were contradictory and others were
impossible of execution. But despite the odds against them&mdash;bereft
of air or sea support and confronted by three heavily
armed divisions only three miles away on Saipan&mdash;the fighting
spirit of the Japanese forces had not been broken by 43
days of the heaviest bombardment, up to then, of the Pacific
war. One of the men of the <i>50th Infantry Regiment</i> wrote in
his diary on 30 June: “We have spent twenty days under unceasing
enemy bombardment and air raids but have suffered
only minor losses. Everyone from the Commanding Officer
to the lowest private is full of fighting spirit.” His
entry for 19 July, five days before the American landings, was
upbeat: “How exalted are the gallant figures of the Force
Commander, the Battalion Commander, and their subordinates,
who have endured the violent artillery and air
bombardment.”

<h2><a name="Counterattack" id="Counterattack"></a><i>Counterattack</i></h2>

<p>At about 1630, the 4th Division
commander, General Cates, ordered
his forces to button up for the night.
A nighttime counterattack was expected.
Barbed wire, preloaded on
amphibian vehicles (DUKWs), was
strung all along the division front.
Ammunition was stacked at every
weapons position. Machine guns
were emplaced to permit interlocking
fields of fire. Target areas were
assigned to mortar crews. Artillery
batteries in the rear were registered
to hit probable enemy approach
routes and to fire illuminating shells
if a lighted battlefield was required.
Of great importance, as it turned out,
was the positioning up front of
37mm guns and cannister ammunition
(antipersonnel shells which fired
large pellets for close-in fighting); in
the night fighting that followed, they
inflicted severe losses on the enemy.</p>

<p>As the troops dug in to await
whatever the night would bring, the
24th Marines, backed up by the 1st<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
Battalion, 8th Marines, occupied the
northern half of the defensive crescent.
The 25th and a battalion of the
23d occupied the southern half of the
crescent with the remainder of the
23d in reserve. On the beaches in the
rear, artillery battalions from the
10th and 14th Marines, engineer battalions,
and other special troops were
on alert.</p>

<p>The Japanese, meanwhile, were
preparing for their counterattack. Because
of shattered communications
lines, it could not be a coordinated
operation. Units would act on their
own under Colonel Ogata’s general
order of 28 June to “destroy the enemy
on beaches with one blow, especially
where time prevents quick
movement of forces within the
island.”</p>

<p>They had on the left or northern
flank of the Marine lines 600 to 1,000
naval troops at the Ushi Point airfields.
Near Mount Lasso, opposite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
the center of the Marine lines, were
two battalions of the <i>50th Infantry
Regiment</i> and a tank company, about
1,500 men all told. On the west coast,
facing the Marine right flank, were
about 250 men from an infantry
company of the <i>50th Regiment</i>, a
tank detachment and an anti-tank
squad.</p>

<p><i>Attacking Marines hold up their advance in the face of an exploding

<p>South of Mount Lasso, nearly six
miles from the White Beaches, was
the Japanese <i>Mobile Counterattack
Force</i>&mdash;a 900-man battalion of the
<i>135th Infantry Regiment</i>, equipped
with new rifles and demolition
charges. Its journey toward the
northwestern beaches and the Marine
lines was perilous. All movements
in daylight were under air
surveillance and vulnerable to
American fire power. But the battalion
set out under its commander&mdash;a
Captain Izumi&mdash;and was hit on
several occasions by unobserved artillery
and naval gunfire. Izumi
pushed on and got to his objective
through skillful use of terrain for
concealment. At 2230 he began probing
the center of the Marine line
where the 2d Battalion, 24th Marines
under Garretson was tied in with the
3d Battalion under Chambers.</p>

<p>“While most of these Japanese
crept along just forward of the lines,”
Carl Hoffman wrote, “... a two-man
reconnaissance detail climbed up on
a battered building forward of the
24th Marines and audaciously (or
stupidly) commenced jotting notes
about, or drawing sketches of, the
front lines. This impudent gesture
was rewarded with a thundering concentration
of U.S. artillery fire.”</p>

<p>Chambers had a vivid memory of
that night:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There was a big gully that ran
from the southeast to northwest
and right into the western edge
of our area. Anybody in their
right mind could have figured
that if there was to be any counterattacks,
that gully would be
used....</p>

<p>During the night ... my men
were reporting that they were
hearing a lot of Japanese chattering
down in the gully....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
They hit us about midnight in
K company’s area. They hauled
by hand a couple of 75mm
howitzers with them and when
they got them up to where they
could fire at us, they hit us very
hard. I think K company did a
pretty damn good job but ...
about 150, 200 Japs managed to
push through [the 1,500 yards]
to the beach area....</p>

<p>When the Japs hit the rear
areas, all the artillery and
machine guns started shooting
like hell. Their fire was coming
from the rear and grazing right
up over our heads.... In the
meantime, the enemy that hit L
company was putting up a hell
of a fight within 75 yards of
where I was and there wasn’t a
damn thing I could do about it.</p>

<p>Over in K company’s area ...
was where the attack really developed.
That’s where [Lt.]
Mickey McGuire ... had his
37mm guns on the left flank
and was firing cannister. Two of
my men were manning a
machine gun [Cpl Alfred J. Daigle
and Pfc Orville H. Showers]....
These two lads laid out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
in front of their machine gun a
cone of Jap bodies. There was
a dead Jap officer in with them.
Both of the boys were dead.</p></blockquote>

  <img src="images/i_016.jpg" width="387" height="260" alt="" />

<div class="captionl">
<p><i>For Tinian, as in the Marshall Islands and the Saipan and Guam operations, DUKWs
(amphibian trucks) were loaded with artillery pieces and ammunition at the mount
out area. At the objective beaches, they were driven ashore right to the designated
gun emplacements enabling the gun crews to get their weapons laid in and firing
quickly. Here, an A-frame unloads a 75mm pack howitzer from an Army DUKW.</i></p></div></div>

<p>A Marine combat correspondent,
described this action:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[Showers and Daigle] held
their fire until the Japanese were
100 yards away, then opened
up. The Japanese charged,
screaming, “Banzai,” firing light
machine guns and throwing
hand grenades. It seemed impossible
that the two
Marines&mdash;far ahead of their
own lines&mdash;could hold on....
The next morning they were
found slumped over their
weapons, dead. No less than
251 Japanese bodies were piled
in front of them.... The Navy
Cross was awarded posthumously
to Daigle and the Silver
Star posthumously to Showers.</p></blockquote>

<p>Just before daybreak, Chambers
recalled, two tank companies showed
up, commanded by Major Robert I.
Neiman. They “wanted to get right
at the enemy” and Chambers sent
them off to an area held by Companies
K and L. Neiman returned in
about a half hour and said, “You
don’t need tanks. You need undertakers.
I never saw so many dead Japs.”</p>

<p>Another large contingent of
Japanese troops was “stacked up” by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
the 75mm pack howitzer gunners of
Battery D of the 14th Marines, supported
by the .50-caliber machine
guns of Batteries E and F: “They literally
tore the Japanese ... to pieces.”
Altogether about 600 Japanese were
killed in their attack on the center.</p>

<p>On the left flank, 1st Battalion,
24th Marines, came under attack at
0200 from about 600 <i>Special Naval
Landing Force</i> troops out of the barracks
at the Ushi Point airfields.
Company A, hit so hard it was
reduced at one point to only 30 men
with weapons, was forced to draw
reinforcements from engineers,
corpsmen, communicators, and
members of the shore party. Illumination
flares were fired over the battlefield,
allowing the Marines to use
37mm cannister shells, machine gun
fire, and mortars to good effect. The
fight continued until dawn when
medium tanks from the 4th Tank
Battalion lumbered in to break up the
last attacking groups. At that point,
many Japanese began using their
grenades to commit suicide.</p>

<p>As the sun rose, 476 Japanese bodies
were counted in this sector of the
defensive crescent, most of them in
front of the Company A position.</p>

<p>The last enemy attack that night
hit the right or southern flank of the
Marines beginning at 0330 when six
Japanese tanks (half of the Japanese
tank force on Tinian) clattered up
from the direction of Tinian Town to
attack the 23d Marines position.
They were met by fire from Marine
artillery, anti-tank guns, bazookas,
and small arms. Lieutenant Jim Lucas,
a professional reporter who enlisted
in the Marine Corps shortly
after the attack on Pearl Harbor and
was commissioned in the field, was
there:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The three lead tanks broke
through our wall of fire. One
began to glow blood-red,
turned crazily on its tracks and
careened into a ditch. A second,
mortally wounded, turned its
machine guns on its tormentors,
firing into the ditches in a last
desperate effort to fight its way
free. One hundred yards more
and it stopped dead in its tracks.
The third tried frantically to
turn and then retreat, but our
men closed in, literally blasting
it apart.... Bazookas knocked
out a fourth tank with a direct
hit which killed the driver. The
rest of the crew piled out of the
turret screaming. The fifth
tank, completely surrounded,
attempted to flee. Bazookas
made short work of it. Another
hit set it afire and its crew was
cremated.</p></blockquote>

<p>The sixth tank was chased off, according
to Colonel Jones, by a Marine
driving a jeep. Some appraisers
of this action believe only five tanks
were involved. In any case, the destruction
of these tanks did not end
the fight on the right flank. Infantry
units of the <i>50th Regiment</i> continued
to attack in the zone of 2d Battalion,
23d Marines. They were repulsed
and killed in great numbers, largely
through the effective use of 37mm
anti-tank guns using cannister shot.
In “the last hopeless moments of the
assault,” Hoffman wrote, “some of the
wounded Japanese destroyed themselves
by detonating a magnetic tank
mine which produced a terrific blast.”</p>

  <img src="images/i_017.jpg" width="386" height="308" alt="" />
</div>

<p>From the Japanese standpoint, the
night’s work had been a disaster:
1,241 bodies left on the battlefield;
several hundred more may have been
carted away during the night. Fewer
than 100 Marines were wounded or
killed. “The loss of these [Japanese]
troops,” the historian Frank Hough
has written:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>... broke the back of the
defense of Tinian. With their
communications shattered by
sustained fire from Saipan and
increasing fire from Tinian itself
... the survivors were capable
of only the weakest, most dazed
sort of resistance.... Now and
again during the next seven
days, small groups took advantage
of the darkness to [launch
night attacks], but for the most
part they simply withdrew in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
no particular order until there
remained nowhere to withdraw.</p></blockquote>

<p>That was a common judgment after
the Tinian battle had ended. But
at the time, according to the 4th Division
intelligence officer, Lieutenant
Colonel Gooderham McCormick, a
Marine Reserve officer who later became
mayor of Philadelphia, things
were not so clear: “We still believed
[after the counterattack] the enemy
capable of a harder fight ... and
from day to day during our advance
expected a bitter fight that never
materialized.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, a lot of hard work
lay ahead. One of the most demanding
tasks was the simple but exhausting
job of humping through cane
fields in terrific heat, humidity, and
frequent monsoon downpours, fearful
not only of sniper fire, mines, or
booby traps, but fearful as well of
fires that could sweep through the
cane fields, incinerating anyone in
their path.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak p0">Preparatory Strikes</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">No</span> battle in the Pacific was a “piece of cake.” But
there was less apprehension among the Americans
about the outcome at Tinian than in any
major operation of the war. Admiral Raymond A. Spruance
later described it as “probably the most brilliantly conceived
and executed amphibious operation of World War II.” Lieutenant
General Holland M. Smith, commander of the Expeditionary
Troops during the seizure of the Marianas,
called it “the perfect amphibious operation.”</p>

<p>It took place under optimal conditions for success. The
small Japanese garrison on the island had no hope of relief,
resupply, escape, or victory. Three miles away, across the
narrow Saipan Channel, three battle-tested American
divisions&mdash;more than 50,000 men&mdash;were available for the
inevitable invasion. For seven weeks the bombardment
from U.S. air and sea armadas, joined by the big guns on
Saipan, had been relentless, day and night.</p>

<p>The effect on Tinian’s civilian inhabitants was recorded
by James L. Underhill, later a Marine lieutenant general,
who became the island’s military commander at the end
of the battle:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The state of these people was indescribable. They
came in with no possessions except the rags on their
backs. They had been under a two-month intense
bombardment and shelling and many were suffering
from shell shock.... They had existed on very scant
rations for six weeks and for the past week had had
practically nothing to eat. They had been cut off from
their own water supply for a week and had caught
what rainwater they could in bowls and cans.
Hundreds of them were wounded and some of their
wounds were gangrenous. Beri beri, syphilis, pneumonia,
dysentery, and tuberculosis were common.
[They needed] shelter, food, water, clothing, medical
care, and sanitation.</p></blockquote>

<p>The bombardment began on 11 June&mdash;four days before
the Saipan invasion&mdash;when carrier planes from Vice Admiral
Marc A. Mitscher’s Task Force 58 launched a three-and-a-half
day pummeling of all the principal Mariana Islands.
A fighter sweep on the first day, carried out by 225
Grumman Hellcats, destroyed about 150 Japanese aircraft
and ensured American control of the skies over the islands.</p>

<p>Following the raid, a member of the Japanese garrison
on Saipan, wrote in his diary: “For two hours, enemy planes
ran amuck and finally left leisurely amidst the unparalleledly
inaccurate antiaircraft fire. All we could do was watch
helplessly.”</p>

<p>Over the next two days, bombers hit the islands and shipping
in the area with no letup. There was a fatalistic diary
entry by one of the Tinian troops: “Now begins our cave
life.” Another soldier wrote of the ineffectual antiaircraft
fire&mdash;“not one hit out of a thousand shots”&mdash;and reported
that “the Naval Air Group has taken to its heels.” Yet another
diarist was indignant, too: “The naval aviators are robbers....
When they ran off to the mountains they stole Army
provisions.”</p>

<p>Fast battleships from Task Force 58 joined the bombardment
from long range on 13 June. Their fires, analysts later
said, were “ineffective” and “misdirected” at soft targets
rather than at the concealed gun positions ringing the island.
But, as an element in the cumulative psychological
and physical toll on soldiers and civilians alike, harassing
fires of this nature were not inconsiderable.</p>

<p>Over the next six weeks, the effort to degrade and destroy
the defenses and garrison of Tinian escalated. On 18
June, Navy Task Force 52, commanded by Rear Admiral
Richmond K. Turner, added its guns to the mission. Air strikes
involving carrier planes and Army P-47s were ordered.
From 28 June until the Tinian landing on 24 July,
massed artillery battalions, firing from Saipan’s southern
shore, poured thousands of tons of steel into the island.
By mid-July, 13 battalions were engaged in the mission, firing
160 guns&mdash;105s and Long Tom 155s&mdash;around the clock.
The six battalions of the XXIV Corps Artillery alone undertook
1,509 fire missions in that period, firing 24,536
rounds.</p>

<p>The precise effect of the artillery fires from Saipan will
never be known, but it is reasonable to assume there were
many scenes of the kind retired Brigadier General Frederick
Karch described in his oral history memoir. He was a young
major, serving as operations officer for an artillery
regiment&mdash;the 14th Marines&mdash;during the Tinian campaign,
and he recalled:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I remember going by a [Japanese] machine gun
crew. They had been trying to get to a firing position
and had been caught by the artillery barrage, apparently,
and they were laid out just like a school solution,
with each man carrying his particular portion
of the gun crew’s equipment. And that was where
they had died in a very fine situation, except they
were on the wrong side of the barrage.</p></blockquote>

<p>During the two weeks from 26 June to 9 July, the cruisers
<i>Indianapolis</i>, <i>Birmingham</i>, and <i>Montpelier</i> hit the island
daily. Their fires were supplemented in the week
preceding Jig Day (the D-day designation for Tinian) by
the battleships <i>Colorado</i>, <i>Tennessee</i>, and <i>California</i>; the
cruisers <i>Louisville</i>, <i>Cleveland</i>, and <i>New Orleans</i>; 16 destroyers;
and dozens of supporting vessels firing a variety
of ordnance ranging from white phosphorous aimed at
wooded areas around the Japanese command post on
Mount Lasso to 40mm fire and rocket barrages by LCIs
(landing craft, infantry) directed at caves and other close-in
targets.

<h3 class="nobreak p0">Aerial Reconnaissance and Photography</h3>

<p class="drop-cap orangecap"><span class="smcap1">In</span> the months leading up to the invasion, intensive
reconnaissance was undertaken. The first aerial
photos of 1944 had been acquired back in February
when U.S. carrier planes attacked Saipan. Others were obtained
in April and May by photo planes based at Eniwetok.
These early photographs were of little use to invasion
planners. Their quality was poor and many were taken at
angles that distorted the terrain.</p>

<p>These inadequacies hampered the Saipan planners but
Tinian was another story. “Perhaps no other Pacific island
...,” Marine Corps analysts later concluded, “became so
familiar to the assault forces because of thorough and accurate
[photography and] mapping prior to the landings.”</p>

<p>A lot of the familiarization came from first-hand observation
by division, regimental, and battalion commanders
who used observation planes to conduct their own reconnaissance
of the Tinian beaches and inland terrain. Lieutenant
Colonel Justice M. Chambers, commander of the
3d Battalion, 25th Marines, described his preinvasion visit
to the island:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There was a lieutenant commander Muller, a naval
aviator, who apparently had a set of roving orders.
He had brought his flight of three Liberators to Saipan....
I thought it would be a good idea to take
my company commanders and overfly the beaches
that we’re going to use.... So the 3rd Battalion
group took the flight and practically all the battalions
did the same.</p>

<p>We took off from Saipan and of course the minute
you were airborne you were over Tinian. I had talked
it over with Muller and told him that the last beach
we would overfly would be the one we were going
to hit. I said, “Let’s take a look at a lot of other beaches
first and fly over the interior.” We made passes at
several beaches. I was standing up in a blister where
I could see and my officers had the bomb bays open
and were looking down. We flew around maybe 20
or 30 minutes, and then we made a big loop and came
back over the beaches we were going to land on. I’m
glad we did because we spotted ... mines in the water
which the Navy got out.</p>

<p>We zoomed in on Mount Lasso, which was the only
mountain on Tinian. The island was just one big cane
field, and Mount Lasso was directly ahead of our
beaches. Muller started pulling out and I began to see
white things zipping by outside the plane.... I was
fighting to keep my stomach down because a fast elevator
is too much for me. I asked: “What’s that?” He
replied, “Twenty millimeter. Where do you want to
go now?” I said, “Saipan. There are no foxholes up
here.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The photographic coverage of Tinian, along with
prisoners and documents captured at Saipan, and other intelligence
available to U.S. commanders, made them, according
to the official history, “almost as familiar with the
Japanese strength at Tinian as was Colonel Ogata [the
Japanese commander].”

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="The_Drive_South" id="The_Drive_South"></a><i>The Drive South</i></h2>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel William W.
“Bucky” Buchanan was the assistant
naval gunfire officer for the 4th Division
at Tinian. His career later took
him to Vietnam. After his retirement
as a brigadier general he recalled the
Tinian campaign:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We used the same tactics on
Tinian that we did on Saipan:
that is, a hand-holding, linear
operation, like a bunch of
brush-beaters, people shooting
grouse or something, the idea
being to flush out every man
consistently as we go down,
rather than driving down the
main road with a fork and cutting
this off and cutting this off
in what I call creative tactics,
you see. But this was the easiest
thing and the safest thing to
do. And who can criticize it? It
was successful. Here, again,
what little resistance was left
was pushed into the end of the
island ... and quickly collapsed.</p></blockquote>

<p>The grouse-shooting metaphor is
simplistic but even the 4th Division
commander, Major General Clifton
B. Cates, thought the campaign had
its sporting aspects: “The fighting
was different from most any that we
had experienced because it was good
terrain.... It was a good clean operation
and I think the men really enjoyed
it.”</p>

<p>Before the “brush beating” could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
begin in proper order, three things
needed to be achieved. First, the 2d
Marine Division had to be put
ashore. This task was completed on
the morning of 26 July&mdash;Jig plus 2.</p>

<div id="ip_19" class="figcenter" style="width: 630px;">
  <img src="images/i_019.jpg" width="630" height="800" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>TINIAN<br />

<span class="subhead">27 JULY&ndash;1 AUGUST 1944</span></p></div></div>

<p>Second, Japanese stragglers and
pockets of resistance in the island’s
northern sector had to be squashed.
That job, for all practical purposes,
was pretty well completed on the
26th as the 2d Division swept across
the Ushi Point airfields, reached the
east coast, and made a turn to the
south. (Two days later, Seabees had
the Ushi Point fields in operation for
Army P-47 Thunderbolt fighters).
Also on the 26th, the 4th Division
had seized Mount Maga in the center
of the island and had forced Colonel
Ogata and his staff to abandon their
command post on Mount Lasso
which fell to the Marines without a
struggle.</p>

<p>The third objective&mdash;to create for
the drive south a skirmish line of infantry
and tanks stretching all the
way across the island&mdash;was also accomplished
on the 26th. The 4th Division
lined up in the western half of
the island with the 23d Marines on
the coast, the 24th in the center, and
the 25th on the left flank. The 2d Division
lined up with the 2d Marines
on the east coast and the 6th Marines
in the center, tied in to the 25th. The
8th Marines remained in the north to
mop up.</p>

<div id="ip_19b" class="figcenter" style="width: 387px;">
  <div class="captionl top"><p><i>Tramping the cane was a tiring work, especially when the direction of the advance
did not parallel the rows of the fields. Each stalk was strong enough to trip a man
careless about where he stepped. Advancing through such a field was fraught with
danger, also, from hidden trip wires attached to demolitions, and from dug-in
Japanese. In addition, the dry cane fields could easily catch fire and trap the Marines.</i></p></div>

<div class="captionr top"><p>Marine Corps Historical Collection</p></div>
  <img src="images/i_019a.jpg" width="387" height="201" alt="" />
</div>

<p>All this was accomplished with
only minor casualties. For 26 July, for
example, the 2nd Division reported
two killed and 14 wounded. The
heaviest losses since the first day and
night of fighting had been sustained
by the 14th Marines, the 4th Division’s
artillery regiment, in the hours
following the Japanese counterattack.
An enemy shell hit the 1st Battalion’s
fire direction center killing the battalion
commander (Lieutenant Colonel
Harry J. Zimmer), the intelligence
officer, the operations officer,
and seven other staff members; 14
other Marines at the battalion headquarters
were wounded. Virtually all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
of the casualties sustained by that
regiment during the Tinian campaign
were taken on this single day, 25 July:
13 of the 14 killed, and 22 of the 29
wounded.</p>

<div id="ip_20" class="figcenter" style="width: 589px;">

<div class="captionl">
<p><i>Marines of the 2d Division find some of the most difficult
terrain on Tinian as they move up towards the top of Mount
Lasso, one of the highest points on the island. Tinian, for the
most part, was flat and level, and was under cultivation.</i></p></div></div>

<p>On the morning of 27 July, the
“brush beating” drive to the south began
in earnest. General Schmidt’s
plan for the first two days of the
drive alternated the main thrust between
the two divisions. In the official
history of the operation, the
tactic was likened to “a man elbowing
his way through the crowd,”
swinging one arm and then the other.</p>

<p>The 2d Division got the heavier
work on the 27th. XXIV Corps Artillery,
firing from southern Saipan,
softened up suspected enemy positions
early in the morning and the division
jumped off at 0730. It
advanced rapidly, harassed by
sporadic small arms fire. By 1345 it
had reached its objective, gaining
about 4,000 yards in just over six
hours. The 4th Division moved out
late in the morning against “negligible
opposition,” reached its objective
by noon and then called it a day. A
Japanese prisoner complained to his
captors, “You couldn’t drop a stick
without bringing down artillery.”</p>

<p>The next morning, 28 July, the 4th
got the “swinging elbow” job. It was
now evident that the remaining
Japanese defenders were rapidly retiring
to the hills and caves along the
southern coast. So opposition to the
Marine advance was virtually nil.
The 4th moved more than two miles
in less than four hours with troops
riding on half-tracks and tanks.
Jumping off again early in the afternoon
in “blitz fashion,” they overran
the airfield at Gurguan Point, led by
Major Richard K. Schmidt’s 4th Tank
Battalion, and quit for the day at
1730 after gaining 7,300 yards&mdash;a little
more than four miles. The 2d Division,
given light duty under the
Schmidt plan, moved ahead a few
hundred yards, reached its objective
in a couple of hours and dug in to
await another morning.</p>

<p>General Cates later recalled how he
spurred on his 4th Division troops:
“I said, ‘Now, look here men, the
[Hawaiian] island of Maui is waiting
for us. See those ships out there? The
quicker you get this over with, the
quicker we’ll be back there.’ They
almost ran over that island.”</p>

<p>On the 29th General Schmidt
dropped the “elbowing” tactic and ordered
both divisions to move as far
and as fast as “practical.” Opposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
had been so light that preparatory
fires were canceled to save unneeded
withdrawals from the diminishing
supplies of artillery shells left on Saipan
and to prevent “waste of naval
gunfire on areas largely deserted by
the enemy.”</p>

<p>The 2d Marines on the eastern terrain
ran into pockets of resistance on
a hill at Masalog Point; the 6th Marines
encountered a 20-man Japanese
patrol that attempted to penetrate the
regiment’s lines after dark. The 25th
took sniper fire as it moved through
cane fields and later in the day engaged
in a heavy firefight with
Japanese troops fighting from dug-in
positions. The Marines suffered
several casualties and one of their
tanks was disabled in this fight. But
the resistance was overcome. The
24th Marines, operating near the
west coast, ran into Japanese positions
that included a series of mutually
supporting bunkers. The 4th
Tank Battalion reported that the area
“had to be overrun twice by tanks”
before resistance ended.</p>

<p>By nightfall, more than half of
Tinian island was in Marine hands.
Troops of the 4th Division could see
Tinian Town from their foxholes.
This was good for morale but the
night was marred by the weather and
enemy activity. A soaking rain fell
through the night. Enemy mortar
tubes and artillery pieces fired incessantly,
drawing counterbattery fire
from Marine gunners. There were
probes in front of the 3d Battalion,
25th Marines, silenced by mortar and
small arms fire; 41 Japanese bodies
were found in the area at daylight.</p>

<p>On 30 July&mdash;Jig plus 6&mdash;Tinian
Town became the principal objective
of the 4th Division and, specifically,
Colonel Franklin A. Hart’s 24th Marines.
At 0735 all of the division’s artillery
battalions laid down preparatory
fires in front of the Marine lines.
After 10 minutes, the firing stopped
and the troops moved out. At the
same time, two destroyers and cruisers
lying in Sunharon Harbor off the
Tinian Town beaches began an hour-long
bombardment of slopes around
the town in support of the Marines.
The regiment’s 1st Battalion had advanced
600 yards when it came under
heavy fire from caves along the
coast north of the town. With the
help of tanks and armored amphibians
operating offshore this problem
was overcome. Flamethrowing tanks
worked over the caves, allowing engineers
to seal them up with demolition
charges. In one cave, a 75mm
gun was destroyed.</p>

<p>The regiment entered the ruins of
Tinian Town at 1420. Except for one
Japanese soldier who was eliminated
on the spot, the town was deserted.
After searching through the
rubble for snipers and documents,
the Marines drove on to the O-7 line
objective south of town. Their
greatest peril was from mines and
booby traps planted in beach areas
and roads.</p>

  <img src="images/i_021.jpg" width="590" height="343" alt="" />
</div>

<p>As the 24th moved south, the 25th
Marines were seizing Airfield Number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
4 on the eastern outskirts of Tinian
Town. The unfinished facility, a
prisoner revealed, was being rushed
to completion to accommodate relief
planes promised by Tokyo. Only one
aircraft was parked on the crushed-coral
air strip&mdash;a small, Zero-type
fighter. Flying suits, goggles, and
other equipment were found in a
supply room.</p>

<p>Enroute to the airfield, the 25th
had taken light small arms fire and
while crossing the airstrip was mortared
from positions to the south.
This was the 25th’s last action of the
Tinian campaign. It went into reserve
and was relieved that night by units
of the 23d Marines and the 1st Battalion,
8th Marines.</p>

<p>The 2d Division, operating to the
east of the 4th, ran into occasional
opposition from machine gun positions
and a 70mm howitzer. The 3d
Battalion, 2d Marines, had the
roughest time. After silencing the
howitzer, it attacked across an open
field and chased a Japanese force into
a large cave where, with the help of
a flame-throwing tank, 89 Japanese
were killed and four machine guns
were destroyed. Soon afterward the
battalion came under mortar fire. “It
is beyond my memory as to the number
of casualties the 3d Battalion
suffered at that time,” the unit’s commander,
Lieutenant Colonel Walter
F. Layer, later reported. “I personally
rendered first aid to two wounded
Marines and remember seeing six
or seven Marines who were either
wounded or killed by that enemy
mortar fire. Tanks and half-tracks
... took the enemy under fire, destroying
the enemy mortars.”</p>

<p>These were minor delays. The division
reached its objective on time
and was dug in by 1830. About 80
percent of the island was now in
American hands.</p>

<hr />
<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="Final_Days" id="Final_Days"></a><i>Final Days</i></h2>

<p>The Japanese were now cornered
in a small area of southeastern Tinian.
The Marines “had advanced so
rapidly that only four square miles
of the island remained for safe firing
by ships not supporting battalions
[i.e., not with shore spotters],” according
to a report on 30 July by Rear
Admiral Harry W. Hill, commander
of the Northern Attack Force.</p>

<p>The Marine commander for the
operation, Major General Schmidt,
saw the end in sight and late on the
afternoon of 30 July issued an operations
order calling on the divisions
to drive all the way to the southeast
coastline, seize all territory remaining
in enemy hands and “annihilate
the opposing Japanese.”</p>

<p>This was not a trifling assignment;
it produced the heaviest fighting since
the counterattack on the night of Jig
Day. A Japanese warrant officer captured
on 29 July estimated that 500
troops of the <i>56th Naval Guard Force</i>
and from 1,700 to 1,800 troops of the
<i>50th Infantry Regiment</i> remained in
the southeastern area in a battle-ready
condition. American intelligence
estimates on 29 July, based on
daily reports from the divisions,
reckoned that 3,000 Japanese soldiers
and sailors had been killed or
taken prisoner up to that point. If
that was the case, two-thirds of the
nearly 9,000 Japanese defenders were
still alive on the island.</p>

<p>The terrain occupied by the
Japanese main force was rugged,
difficult to reach or traverse and well-suited
for defense. Outside of Tinian
Town the gentle landscape ended,
with the ground rising to a high
plateau 5,000 yards long and 2,000
yards wide, with altitudes higher
than 500 feet. The plateau was rocky
and covered with thick brush. There
were many caves. Along the east
coast, the cliff walls rose steeply and
appeared impossible to scale. The approaches
to the plateau were blocked
by many cliffs of this sort as well as
by jungle growth. A road in the
center of the plateau, leading to its
top, was reported by a prisoner to be
mined. The plateau was the enemy’s
last redoubt.</p>

<div id="ip_22" class="figcenter" style="width: 389px;">
  <div class="captionl top"><p><i>As a Navy corpsman administers a bottle of plasma to a wounded Marine, the

</div>

<p>It became the object of the most
intense bombardments any Japanese
force had yet experienced to date in
World War II. Marine artillery regiments
on the island and the XXIV
Corps Artillery on southern Saipan
fired throughout the night of 30&ndash;31
July on the wooded clifflines the Marines
would face during their assault.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
At 0600, the battleships <i>Tennessee</i>
and <i>California</i>, the heavy cruiser
<i>Louisville</i>, and the light cruisers
<i>Montpelier</i> and <i>Birmingham</i> began
the first of two sustained bombardments
that morning. They fired for
75 minutes, then halted to allow a 40-minute
strike on the plateau by 126
P-47s, North American Mitchell B-25
bombers, and Grumman Avenger
torpedo bombers from the escort carrier
<i>Kitkun Bay</i>. The planes dropped
69 tons of explosives before the offshore
gunfire resumed for another 35
minutes. All told, the battleships and
cruisers fired approximately 615 tons
of shells at their targets. Artillerymen
of the 10th Marines fired about 5,000
rounds during the night; 14th Marines
gunners fired 2,000. The effect,
one prisoner said, was “almost unbearable.”</p>

<div class="captionl">
<p><i>Some badly wounded casualties died of their severe injuries after having been evacuated

<p>As you faced south on that morning,
the regimental alignments from
west coast to east coast were the 24th,
23d, 8th, 6th and 2d Marines. The
task of the 24th was to clear out the
western coastal area, with one battalion
assigned to seizure of the
plateau. The 2d Marines was to seal
off the east coast at the base of the
plateau. The 6th, 8th, and 23d Marines
would assault the cliff areas and
make their way to the top of the
plateau.</p>

  <div class="captionl top"><p><i>Two Marines escort two apparently healthy, hearty, and willing

</div>

<p>The 24th, jumping off with the 23d
at 0830, moved into the coastal plain
and immediately encountered brush
and undergrowth so dense that tank
operations were severely hampered.
As compensation, armored amphibians
lying offshore provided heavy
fires against enemy beach positions
and covered the regiment’s right flank
as it made its way down the coast.
A platoon-size Japanese beach unit
launched a foolish counterattack on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
the 1st Battalion, 24th Marines at
about 1000. The Japanese were annihilated.
Later, flame-throwing
tanks burned off brush and undergrowth
concealing Japanese riflemen.</p>

<p><i>Tank-infantry tactics perfected in prior operations proved successful on Tinian as
well. The riflemen served as the eyes of the armored vehicle and would direct the

<p>On the regiment’s left flank, the 3d
Battalion was in assault at the base
of the plateau. It encountered minimal
opposition until about 1600
when it began to receive rifle and
machine gun fire from cliff positions.
Tanks were called on but soon found
themselves mired in a minefield and
were held up for several hours while
engineers cleared 45 mines from the
area.</p>

<p>The 1st Battalion, 23d Marines,
encountered similar troubles. As the
regiment approached the plateau, it
ran into dense small arms fire from
two positions&mdash;a small village at the
base of the cliff and from the cliff face
itself. It also began receiving fire
from a “large-caliber weapon.” Lacking
tank support the Marines pressed
forward, running a few yards, diving
on their bellies, getting up, and advancing
again. Medium tanks finally
came up in search of this elusive and
well-concealed weapon. One of them
took six quick hits from the concealed
position of this Japanese gun.
A second tank was hit but in the
process the enemy position was discovered:
a camouflaged, concrete
bunker housing a 47mm antitank
gun and 20 troops, all of whom were
killed.</p>

</div>

<p>The 2d Battalion of the 23d had
similar difficulties. After coming under
fire from riflemen and machine
gunners, one of its supporting tanks
was disabled by a mine. After its
crew was taken to safety by another
tank, the disabled vehicle was seized
by the Japanese and used as an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
armored machine gun nest. Other
tanks soon took it out. The 23d also
lost that day two 37mm guns and a
one-ton truck belonging to the regiment’s
half-track platoon. The guns
and the vehicle got too far out front,
came under heavy fire and were
abandoned. A detail from the platoon
later retrieved one of the guns,
removed the breech block from the
other one and brought back the
.50-caliber machine gun from its
mounting on the truck.</p>

<div id="ip_25" class="figcenter" style="width: 593px;">
  <div class="captionl top"><p><i>Tinian Town was made a shambles because U.S. commanders

<p>Late in the afternoon, the 1st Battalion,
23d Marines, and a company
from the 2d Battalion gained a
foothold on top of the plateau; the
3d Battalion soon followed. To their
left, the 3d Battalion, 8th Marines,
shrugged off small arms fire early in
the day and reached the base of the
cliff where it stalled for the night.
The 1st Battalion had better luck.
Company A made it to the top of the
plateau at 1650, followed by a platoon
from Company C. Soon after,
the whole battalion was atop the hill.
It was followed by Companies E and
G of the 2d Battalion.</p>

<p>The Company G commander was
Captain Carl W. Hoffman, who later
wrote the definitive histories of the
Saipan and Tinian campaigns. In an
oral history interview, he described
his own experiences on top of the
plateau the night of 31 July:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>By the time we got up there
... there wasn’t enough daylight
left to get ourselves
properly barbed-wired in, to get
our fields of fire established, to
site our interlocking bands of
machine gun fire&mdash;all the things
that should be done in preparing
a good defense.</p>

<p>By dusk, the enemy commenced
a series of probing attacks.
Some Japanese intruded
into our positions. It was a completely
black night. So, with
Japanese moving around in our
positions, our troops became
very edgy and were challenging
everybody in sight. We didn’t
have any unfortunate incidents
of Marines firing on Marines
... [because they] were well-seasoned
by this point....</p>

<p>As the night wore on, the intensity
of enemy attacks started
to build and build and build.
They finally launched a full
scale <i>banzai</i> attack against [our]
battalion.... The strange
thing the Japanese did here was
that they executed one wave of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
attack after another against a
37mm position firing cannister
ammunition....</p>

<p>That gun just stacked up
dead Japanese.... As soon as
one Marine gunner would drop
another would take his place.
[Eight of 10 men who manned
the gun were killed or wounded].
Soon we were nearly
shoulder-high with dead
Japanese in front of that
weapon.... By morning we
had defeated the enemy.
Around us were lots of dead
ones, hundreds of them as a
matter of fact. From then on
... we were able to finish the
rest of the campaign without
difficulty.... People have
often said that the Tinian campaign
was the easiest campaign
... in the Pacific....</p>

<p>For those Marines who were
in that 37mm position up on
the escarpment, Tinian had to
be the busiest campaign within
the Pacific war.</p></blockquote>

the heavy shelling visited upon the town before the landing.</i></p></div></div>

<p>Hoffman had another lively experience
before leaving the island. He
was a trumpet addict and carried his
horn with him all through the Pacific
war:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>For Tinian, I didn’t take any
chances such as sending my
horn ashore in a machine gun
cart or a battalion ambulance.
I had it flown over to me. One
evening, my troops were in a little
perimeter with barbed wire
all around us on top of the cliff.
My Marines were shouting in
requests: “Oh, You Beautiful
Doll” and “Pretty Baby” and
others. While I was playing
these tunes, all of a sudden we
heard this scream of “<i>banzai</i>.”
An individual Japanese soldier
was charging right toward me
and right toward the barbed
wire. The Marines had their
weapons ready and he must
have been hit from 14 different
directions at once. He didn’t get
to throw [his] grenade.... I’ve
always cited him as the individual
who didn’t like my
music. He was no supporter of
my trumpet playing. But ... I
even continued my little concert
after we had accounted for him.</p></blockquote>

<p>A final <i>banzai</i> attack on the night
the 37mm guns had their big harvest,
occurred in the early morning hours
of 1 August. A 150-man Japanese
force attacked the 1st Battalion, 28th
Marines, on Hoffman’s left flank. After
30 minutes, the main thrust of the
attack was spent and at dawn the
Japanese withdrew; 100 bodies lay in
an area 70 yards square in front of
the position of Company E, 2d Battalion,
28th Marines. The 8th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
Marines took 74 casualties that night.</p>

<p>The following morning the two divisions
went back to work. The 2d
moved across the plateau toward its
eastern cliffs, the 4th toward cliffs on
the south and west. When they
reached the escarpment’s edge, overlooking
the ocean, their job was essentially
done. At 1855, General
Schmidt declared the island “secure,”
meaning that organized resistance
had ended. But not the killing.
Hundreds of Japanese troops remained
holed up in the caves pock-mocking
the southern cliffs rising up
from the ocean.</p>

<p>On the morning of 2 August, a
Japanese force of 200 men sallied
forth in an attack on the 3d Battalion,
6th Marines. After two hours of
combat, 119 Japanese were dead.
Marine losses included the battalion
commander, Lieutenant Colonel John
W. Easley. Shortly afterwards, the
regiment’s 2d Battalion, led by Lieutenant
Colonel Edmund B. Games,
was hit by 100 Japanese, 30 of whom
were killed before the unit withdrew.</p>

<p>Contacts of this kind continued for
months. By the end of the year,
Colonel Clarence R. Wallace’s 8th
Marines, left on Tinian for mopping-up
operations, had lost 38 killed and
125 wounded; Japanese losses were
500 dead.</p>

<p>Beginning on 1 August, there were
large-scale surrenders by civilians
leaving the caves in which they had
taken refuge. Marine intelligence
officers estimated that 5,000 to 10,000
civilians had been hiding out in the
southeast sector.</p>

<p>Marine Major General James L.
Underhill, who took command of the
island as military governor on 10 August,
became responsible for the care
and feeding of these civilians. The
flow of civilian refugees began on
August 1, he recalled:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>About 500 came through immediately,
the next day about
800, then a thousand and then
two thousand and so on in increasing
numbers until about
8,000 were in. The remaining
3,000 hid out in caves and dribbled
in over a period of months.
About 30 percent adult males,
20 percent adult females, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
about 50 percent children.
Many of them were in bad
shape&mdash;hungry, wounded, ill
and with few possessions beyond
the clothes they were
wearing.</p></blockquote>

<p>It was estimated that about 4,000
civilians were killed in the bombardments
of Tinian and in fighting on
the island. On Saipan, Marines had
been helpless to prevent mass suicides
among the civilian population. They
were more successful at Tinian. Unfortunate
incidents occurred&mdash;civilians,
for example, dying under
Marine fire after wandering into the
lines at night.</p>

<p>There were also suicides and ritual
murders, as indicated in a report
from the 23d Marines on 3 August:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Several freak incidents occurred
during the day: (1) Jap
children thrown [by their parents]
over cliff into ocean; (2)
[Japanese] military grouped
civilians in numbers of 15 to 20
and attached explosive charges
to them, blowing them to bits;
(3) Both military and civilians
lined up on the cliff and hurled
themselves into the ocean; (4)
Many civilians pushed over cliff
by [Japanese] soldiers.</p></blockquote>

<p>Efforts to prevent incidents of this
kind were generally successful. Marines
used amplifiers on land and offshore
to promise good treatment to
civilians and soldiers who would surrender
peacefully. “Thousands of
civilians,” Hoffman wrote, “many
clad in colorful Japanese silk,
responded to the promises&mdash;though
it was plain from the expressions on
their faces that they expected the
worst.”</p>

Fully aware of the danger involved, he
was moving forward while the remainder
of the squad, armed with automatic
rifles, closed together in the
rear when an enemy grenade landed in

<p>By 14 August the entire 4th Division
had embarked on the long trip
to its base camp on Maui. It had suffered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
in this brief operation more
than 1,100 casualties, including 212
killed. Its next assignment would be
Iwo Jima.</p>

<p>The 2d Division remained in the
Marianas, setting up a base camp on
Saipan where the 2d and 6th regiments
took up residence in mid-August.
The 8th Marines remained
on Tinian for mopping-up purposes
until October 25, when the 2d and
3d Battalions moved to Saipan, leaving
an unhappy 1st Battalion behind
until its relief at the end of the year.</p>

<p>The campaign for Tinian had cost
the division 760 casualties, including
105 killed. These numbers did not include
casualties suffered after the island
was “secured” on 1 August.</p>

<p>Japanese military losses, based on
bodies counted and buried, totaled
5,000. Other thousands are assumed
to have been sealed up in caves and
underground fortifications. The
number of prisoners taken was 250
by some counts and 400 by others.</p>

<p>The capture of the Marianas gave
the Army Air Corps the B-29 bases
it needed for the bombing of Japan.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
They were located 1,200 nautical
miles from the home islands of
Japan, a distance ideal for the B-29
with its range of 2,800 miles. Tinian
became the home for two wings of
the Twentieth Air Force. Three
months after the conquest of Tinian,
B-29s were hitting the Japanese mainland.
Over the next year, according
to numbers supplied by the Air Force
to historian Carl Hoffman, the B-29s
flew 29,000 missions out of the Marianas,
dropped 157,000 tons of explosives
which, by Japanese estimates
killed 260,000 people, left 9,200,000
homeless, and demolished or burned
2,210,000 homes.</p>

<p>Tinian’s place in the history of warfare
was insured by the flight of <i>Enola
Gay</i> on 6 August 1945. It dropped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
a nuclear weapon on Hiroshima.
Two days later a second nuclear
weapon was dropped on Nagasaki.
The next day, the Japanese government
surrendered.</p>

<p>In his official history of the 2d Marine

records the reaction when news of
the surrender reached the division at
its base on Saipan:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>They looked at Tinian’s clean
and rocky coast, at the coral
boulders where they had gone
ashore, and they thought of the
forbidding coasts of Japan&mdash;the
coasts that awaited them in the
fall. “That Tinian was a pretty
good investment, I guess,” one
Marine finally said.</p></blockquote>
